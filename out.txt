################## answer from JuniorDev :

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to directly build or lint an application. However, I can suggest some tools and steps that you can take to achieve this task. Here are the steps you can follow:

1::: runCommand(npm run lint) - To run the linting command and check for any errors in the code.
2::: runCommand(npm run lint -- --fix) - To fix any errors that were found during the linting process.
3::: runCommand(npm run build) - To build the application and generate the production-ready code.
4::: finishedanswer - To send the result to the user.

Please note that these commands assume that you have a Node.js project with a package.json file and the necessary dependencies installed. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

userMessage:
INTERNAL ERROR: can only concatenate str (not "list") to str



################## answer from SeniorDev :

This error message usually occurs when you try to concatenate a string with a list. To fix this error, we need to find where in the code this error is occurring.

Here are the steps to fix this error:

$$$
1 ::: readFile(package.json) - To check the scripts in the package.json file
2 ::: searchGpt(how to concatenate a string with a list in javascript) - To find out how to concatenate a string with a list in javascript
3 ::: juniorDevGpt ( check the code for any concatenation of a string with a list )
4 ::: juniorDevGpt ( fix the code by converting the list to a string before concatenation )
5 ::: juniorDevGpt ( test the code to make sure the error is fixed )
$$$

Let me know if you have any questions or if you need more information.

################## answer from SeniorDev :

Thank you for providing the `package.json` file. Based on the file, it seems like the application is using Next.js, React, Typescript, and Sass.

To fix the `INTERNAL ERROR: can only concatenate str (not "list") to str` error, we need to check the code for any concatenation of a string with a list and convert the list to a string before concatenation.

Here are the steps to fix the error:

$$$
1 ::: juniorDevGpt ( open the code editor )
2 ::: juniorDevGpt ( search for any concatenation of a string with a list )
3 ::: juniorDevGpt ( convert the list to a string before concatenation )
4 ::: juniorDevGpt ( test the code to make sure the error is fixed )
5 ::: juniorDevGpt ( run the `npm run lint` command to check for any other errors )
6 ::: juniorDevGpt ( run the `npm run build` command to build the application )
7 ::: juniorDevGpt ( test the application to make sure it is working as expected )
$$$

Let me know if you have any questions or if you need more information.
